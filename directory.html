<h1>The Directory</h1>
<p>
This is the link directory for people who do not have a site or the ability to add a snippet of code to a site. If that sounds like you, you may join the
        directory instead of being looped into the ring. Though if you would like to be listed in the directory, I ask
        that you consider if you are someone who needs the eyes on your work, if you don't have a site, I would
        prefer you are someone who isn't just a cishet white person making vanilla stuff. I hope you can understand! If
        you do chose to make a site later on though, everyone is welcome to be in the ring.
  </p>
<h2>Join</h2>
<p>All rules apply from the regular<a href="https://kink-and-fetish-webring.netlify.app/join"> member rules</a>, aside from the one that says you need a site, lol.</p>
<p>If you would like to join this directory, please email me at contact@117.zone with the following info filled out, and "directory" somewhere in your subject line!</p>
