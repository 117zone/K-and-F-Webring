<h1>THE KINK & FETISH WEBRING</h1>
<p>So this is the Kink and Fetish Webring. You also just saw that in the title text above.</p>
<p>If you don't know what a webring is... it is just a loop of websites that link to each other through a little widget type thing on their site, so you can traverse a ring of sites made by people with a certain interest or whatever. 
  This webring? It's for people who make fetish and kink content. This is a place where even the "weird" kink enjoyers are welcome. If you like pooltoys and tf, you are as welcome as someone who is into bdsm.  </p>

<p>If you wanna <a href="{{'/join'|relative_url}}">join the webring</a>, just follow that link, the rules on joining are in there too.</p>

<p>If the ring is fucked up/broken/busted, let me know by <a href={{site.github_repo_url}}/issues/new>submitting an error report on GitHub</a>, if you're savvy, or if you'd rather you may simply <a href="mailto:contact@117.zone">email me.
</a>
