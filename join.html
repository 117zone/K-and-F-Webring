<H1>joining the webring</H1>
      <p>If you want to join the ring, you must be able to add a short section of code to your site in order to add
        the ring widget. Handcrafted sites preferred, but if you are using a builder, please have made it yours and
        given it some love. It's all about having an individual space on the net, amidst all the... stuff.</p>

      <h2>webring rules</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>You must be 18 or older, and your site/your work should contain some kind of fetish or kink content and if
          not, it should have some form of adult/nsfw content. Though it doesn't have to be crazy explicit, and those
          who like kink as comfort are more than welcome. You get the idea, right?</li>
        <li>Your site must be more than a just link hub, and have your work (writing, art, ect) on it, and at least some
          of it accessible without paying.</li>
        <li>Any form of bigotry on your site will prevent you from joining, or get you removed. As will any AI content
        </li>
        <li>I reserve the right to remove anyone from this ring at my discretion for breaking these rules OR as I see
          fit/needed.</li>

      </ul>    
      <h3>Dead Dove</h3>
      <p>if your website is mainly focused on the following content, please mark it as such, and you'll get a little
        icon next to your site name that lets people seek out this general umbrella of content, or avoid it altogether!
        If you don't focus on it, and only have like one or two pieces/works that fit the bill, don't worry about
        labeling your site as such. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-Con:</strong> Explicitly non consensual sexual acts. Dub-con isn't included. Marking your content
          as dub-con for
          those who wish not to see it though is always appreciated!
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bestiality & similar: </strong>Can it think? No? Still fucking it/it's fucking you? Goes here.</li>
        <li><strong>Extreme brutality, violence, torture: </strong>What it says on the tin. </li>
        <li><strong>Gore, necro, hard vore: </strong>Likewise. Soft vore not included!</li>
        </ul>
<h3>Prohibited Content</h3>
   <p>Underage and incest. (selfcest is fine!)
    </p> 
    <p>Since the webring is gonna be vetted by uh... one guy... I have one personal hard limit of what I'm unwilling to see while vetting your sites, and as such, it's not going to be allowed. Sorry yall!! </p>
